Simply type 'meryl' in the current working directory.
You can also pass an argument denoting root directory.

  $ meryl <rootpath>

You can create a module named 'boot.js' in the root directory
which exports a function that accepts Meryl instance.

  module.exports = function (meryl) {
    // config meryl
  }
